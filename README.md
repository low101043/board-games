# Classic Games

This is a Java Project where I want to implement different board games.

## Goals
- To implement a multiplayer version of these games
    - Naughts & Crosses - Implemented
    - Connect 4 - Implemented
    - Chess - This is the hardest

- To implement the Minimax algorithm for all three games above - I will obviously try and speed up the process (Using alph-beta pruning among other things)

- To implement a UI
    - Intially just a Command Line interface
    - Ultimately a Graphical User Interface
    
   - AI
    - Naughts & Crosses has AI which can be used
    - Connect Four has AI which is not used (This is because it uses MinMax and my laptop does not have enough memory)
